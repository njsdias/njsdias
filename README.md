### Hello. I'm Nuno.

I'm Data Scientist with experience in problems related with time-series, geolocation and text mining.

My curiosity takes me explore the state of the art of several ML models. 

I'm interested in problems that involves: 
- engineer & IoT,
- signal processing,
- anomaly detection,
- NLP,
- computer vision. 

In my github you can find several courses related with: 
- Fundaments of Machine Learning,
- Deep Learning (NLP and Computer Vision), 
- API's development,
- Big Data using Spark and Scala, 
- develop tests using pytest.

To be updated I'm always searching for the new frameworks and methodologies.
Due to this you can find in my Github courses relaed wih 
- Tensorflow, 
- Pytorch (Pyro).

I hope you can find in my repository something usefull for you.

If you have any addtional question reach me in
