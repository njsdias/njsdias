I'm Data Scientist with experience in problems related with time-series, geolocation and text mining.
My curiosity takes me explore the state of the art of several ML models. 
I'm very interested in problems that involves engineer, signal processing, anomaly detection, NLP and computer vision 

In my github you can find several courses related with: Fundaments of Machine Learning, Deep Learning (NLP and Computer Vision), development of APi's,
Big Data using Spark and Scala and develop tests using pytest.

To be updated I'm always searching for the new tendencies. Due to this you can find in my Github courses about Tensorflow and Pytorch (Pyro).

I hope you can find in my repository something usefull for you.
